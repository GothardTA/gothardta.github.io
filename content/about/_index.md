# About Me
My name is Trooper Gothard and I am currently a high school student. I like to create many things, some of which are presented on this website. I am most interested in Mechatronics engineering. In my free time I like to mountain bike and I race competitively for my school's team. I am also a part of my school's TSA team and I have competed in the UAV Drone challenge, while my team didn't win, we got top 10! I also participated in Lockheed Martin's Code Quest.
