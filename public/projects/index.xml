      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;quick-info&#34;&gt;Quick Info&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a UAV drone primarily built by me with the help from my friends. This drone was built for the Technology Student Association (TSA) competition. The goal of this competition was to be able to fly through obstacles while transporting payloads. The more payloads you transported successfully, the more points you get. The counts toward your overall placement against other teams. This drone was built during the 2023-2024 school year and semi-finaled at the Colorado state competition in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
